   <h1>[WL-News] Wikileaks Analysis Release: How Britan Got The Bomb</h1>
   <div id="thestuff">
    <p>William G. Penney, the father of the British atom bomb, spent most of 1944 and 1945 at Los Alamos helping the United States build the first two atomic bomb. He formed part of the British Mission, an elite team of Los Alamos British scientists and emigres who contributed to the development, testing and use of atomic weapons. Penney, sent to Los Alamos as a specialist on ocean waves, soon found his gifts were readily apparent and he was made one of the five members of the Los Alamos "brain trust". The group made key decisions in the direction of the weapons program, putting him in the company of Robert Oppenheimer, John Von Neumann, "Deke" Parsons and Norman Ramsey. On 27 April 1945 Penney became one of only two representatives from Los Alamos (and the only Briton) to be part of the ten man Target Committee responsible for drawing up a list of prospective Japanese atomic bomb sites. Penney travelled to Tinian Island in the Pacific to be on hand for planning and briefing the atomic bombing missions. Penney actually witnessed the bombing of Nagasaki, flying in an observation plane accompanying the attack. Afterwards he conducted damage surveys of the ruined city.</p>
    <p>Penney returned to Imperial College immediately after the war, but accepted an appointment to head up the Armament Research Department (ARD) on 1 January 1946. On 8 January 1947 the secret GEN.163 Cabinet committee of six Ministers (headed by PM Attlee) decided to proceed with a British effort to acquire atomic weapons. Penney did not receive word of this decision until May 1947 when he was finally asked by Lord Portal to lead the British effort. The decision was not disclosed publicly in any respect until 12 May 1948, when an oblique reference was made to atomic weapon development in British parliamentary discussions.</p>
    <p>In June 1947 Penney began assembling a team to work on the bomb. One of his first steps was to prepare a document describing the features of the U.S. plutonium implosion bomb, breaking down the development tasks required to replicate it, and identifying outstanding questions that required further research. The report, completed on 1 July, was entitled "Plutonium Weapon - General Description" (U.K, Public Record Office File AVIA 65/1163, "Implosion") and gave the British atomic weapons program a preliminary design description roughly equivalent in terms of detail to the description provided the Soviets by Klaus Fuchs.</p>
